# Big Data with Spark

### Summary:
Imagine you are working as a data scientist for a popular digital media provider such as Spotify. Many of users stream their favorite songs to your service every day either using a free tier that places ads between the songs or the premium tier that charges a flat monthly rate. users can upgrade, downgrade or cancel their services any time, so it's crucial to make sure that they love the service.

Everytime a user interacts with the service while they're playing a song, logging out, watching an ad etc, it generates data. All of this data contains the key insights for keeping your users happy and helping your business thrive. It's your job as a Data Scientist to predict when a user is likely to churn, which either means downgrading from premium or cancelling their service all together.

If you can accurately identify these users before they leave, you will be able to offer them incentives to keep them as a customer for longer, potentially saving your business tons of money in revenue.
